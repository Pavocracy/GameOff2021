# GameOff2021  
**My BUGGY mess of a gameoff entry**  
  
This project is using the [phaser 3 typescript template from photonstorm](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-typescript-project-template).  
It uses Phaser 3.50 with [TypeScript 4](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) for bundling.  
This allows for intellisense to work in VS code while writing typescript, and compiles the game to javascript.  
I use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to serve the game locally, and `npm run build` to compile.  
This repo excluses modules and config files. Its only purpose is to show my game code and have a place to grab the distribution files for hosting on my own domain.
